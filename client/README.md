# Things to add that I didn't get too - Taylor 
 1) Hash all URL links in admin panel or use protected routes to see if there is a jwt token active before going to the url for admin controls  
 2) Design and implement Contribution Page
 3) Event calendar
 4) Detailed Student Project Blog Post (I only have the tiny thumbnail so far)
 5) Get Submitted Pictures working (ex. when a student submits a headshot they want to use for their project, it only stores the url and not the actual picture)
 6) Implement the filter by category in Tech Articles, Student Resources, and Student Highlights
